# Transfer_Learning_ResNet-50_Python
Cat, dog, and horse prediction using Transfer-Learning using ResNet-50 with help of Python.
### This notebook talks about how to start with Transfer-Learning using ResNet50.
#### We would use the help of the keras for using the ResNet-50 and we train and build a image classifier for classifying whether the image is dog,cat or horse.
